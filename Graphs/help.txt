1. DFS - A Depth First Search is: diving from a root node into a tree or graph until reaching the lowest points of all branches (vertically).

         /
        4

*we go 0-4 then 0-1
*we accomplish this by using LIFO during exploration

2. BFS - A Breadth First Search is: diving from a root node into a tree and exploring all branches as you discover them horizonitally.

*we go 0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6
*we accomplish this by using FIFO during exploration
